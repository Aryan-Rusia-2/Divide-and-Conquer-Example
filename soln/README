Weekly Exercise 7 - Divide and Conquer
-------------------------------------------


Included Files :

  1) climbing.cpp
  2) climbing.sh
  3) README
  4) Makefile
 

Running Instructions :
	
	1) OPen the terminal and go to the soln directory
	2) Type make to compile the code
	3) GIve inputs using terminal and get the desired results
	4) If one wants to run the test cases, then do the following -
		i) Type cd .. to go one directory back
		ii) Type make, and this will run the test cases.


	
Files Modified OR Added :

	i) climbing.cpp

	ii) README

	iii) Makefile


NOtes and Assumptions :

	1) I declared a function 'uint climbing(const uint *heights, uint length, uint rest, uint limit)' which determines the minimum burst time

	2) Time complexity of the solution is O(length*log(limit))

	3) I have implemented binary search to find the minimum burst tine.

	4) All the stdin and stdout is done in the main function.
